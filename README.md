Drinkalculator
==============

Drinkalculator is a Ruby on Rails project that I created to help the good people of Hong Kong guage their drinking habits over time.  It includes:

- Secure login functionality using bcrypt, including password strength detection
- Ability to add drinks to the user profile over time (with information being stored in a Mongo database)
- Ability to review drinking habits over time, with graphical visualisation using Morris.js
